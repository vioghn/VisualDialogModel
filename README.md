# VisualDialogModel
 This project presents a visual dialog system based on late fusion architecture to address image-related questions containing dialog his004 tory on the Stack Overflow platform. a data set comprising around 10,000 instances of ques006 tions has been collected, along with their cor007 responding correct answers, images and rele008 vant dialogues extracted from comments. The model consists of three encoders and one de010 coder. The text decoder is pretrained on Ubuntu dialog dataset, which is related to computer questions, and then implemented with two lan013 guage models: Pix2Struct as the image encoder and the pre-trained DialoGPT model as the textencoder-decoder. This study illustrates the ap016 plicability of the visual dialog systems as a technique for answering image- related ques018 tions on StackOverflow. 
 However, it is important to note that this project is not fully trained due to a lack of proper resources. I am still working on improving and refining the system.
